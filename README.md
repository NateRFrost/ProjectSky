# WELCOME TO PROJECT SKY!
### VERSION 2.0.0

### HOW TO USE:
1. Open ProjectSky.exe
2. Configs will automatically be set. You can edit them by clicking the dropdown menu in the corner and clicking on "Edit Config".
3. Choose your desired editor. (NOTE: Move editor is still not out yet!!! Will be out soon though, I promise.)
4. Edit to your heart's content.
5. Click the back button and save. (Exiting out of the window will delete your progress.)
6. Your exported ZIP file will be in the output folder you set (or the default one) in the config window!
7. To use the mod, simply import it into Trinity Mod Loader!

### WHAT CAN THIS TOOL DO?
1. Edit Pokemon base stats, EV yields, XP growth rate, abilities, typing, gender ratio, held items, and whether it's in the game or not (do not do that last thing unless you know what you're doing.)
2. Edit Pokemon evolutions
3. Edit Pokemon learnsets
4. Edit trainer teams and stats

If you want a save editing tool, use PKHeX by kwsch.

### COMING SOON:
1. Move stat editor
2. Egg move editor (maybe)

### HOW TO REPORT BUGS:
Go to the issues section of the ProjectSky Github page (at github.com/svfeplvce/ProjectSky) and submit an issue.

### IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. Inherent moves in the moveset editor will show up as level 253.
2. You can set the level in the moveset editor to be above level 100 but that will break your game. Don't do it.
